## Connecting Android app with PayuMoney 

In this project we are connecting the PayuMoney API with android application for the accepting the payment from client through our application.

The first step is to create an account with Payu.

Payu provides two different mode of operations that is Live Mode and Test Mode. Test Mode helps the developer to test the transaction process before launching the app. Live Mode is used for accepting the real time transaction from users.
